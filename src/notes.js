//First thing to do is create a form similar to the video. It doesn't need to be exactly the same thing either.

//Components needed - Nav, Home, Posts, Login (possibly single posts as well)

//All posts are coming from our API. Put that data into our state and render to the page

//We don't need to have an edit button, it's too advanced for now.

//For the form, we're using POST instead of GET
